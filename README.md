### 👋 Hi there! I'm Antoine Bonnet

I'm a Natural Language Processing (NLP) researcher in the [EPFL LLM team](https://huggingface.co/epfl-llm) collaborating with the [NLP](https://nlp.epfl.ch) and [MLO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/) labs at EPFL. My current focus is adapting Large Language Models for healthcare.

My latest project is **MEDITRON**, currently the best open-source medical Large Language Model (LLM) in the world.

We've been working with an amazing team of 20 researchers from EPFL and Yale School of Medicine for the past 6 months to train this model on high-quality medical knowledge. 

We've publicly released the weights for [Meditron-70B](https://huggingface.co/epfl-llm/meditron-70b) and [Meditron-7B](https://huggingface.co/epfl-llm/meditron-7b) on Huggingface.
