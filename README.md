## 💡 Hi there!

I'm a Masters student at EPFL and Natural Language Processing (NLP) researcher in the [EPFL LLM team](https://huggingface.co/epfl-llm) collaborating with the [NLP](https://nlp.epfl.ch) and [MLO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/) labs. My current focus is on adapting Large Language Models for healthcare.

🚨 Evaluating medical AI models is hard. We're building a space to fix that.

🧬 The **Moove** is a collaborative platform where doctors can share their expertise to align AI with real-world medical standards.

🏥 We're currently working hard to bring the Moove to life, in collaboration with humanitarian organizations (WHO, ICRC) and Swiss hospitals (CHUV, HUG).

🧪 **Meditron** is a suite of open-source medical foundation large language models (LLMs). 

🎁 We've publicly released the weights for [Meditron-70B](https://huggingface.co/epfl-llm/meditron-70b) and [Meditron-7B](https://huggingface.co/epfl-llm/meditron-7b) on Huggingface. 

🩺 We're now working on the next generation of Meditron, building on Meta's Llama-3.
