## 💡 Hi there!

I'm Antoine Bonnet, a NLP researcher at EPFL collaborating with the [NLP](https://nlp.epfl.ch), [MLO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/) and [LiGHT](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/light/) labs. My current focus is on medical large language models.

🚨 Evaluating medical AI models is hard. We're building a space to fix that.

🧬 The **Moove** is a collaborative platform where doctors can share their expertise to evaluate and align AI with real-world medical standards.

🏥 **Coming soon!** We're currently working hard to bring it to life, collaborating with humanitarian organizations (WHO, ICRC) and hospitals (CHUV, HUG).

🧪  **Meditron** is a suite of open-source medical foundation large language models (LLMs). 

🎁 We've publicly released the weights for [Meditron-70B](https://huggingface.co/epfl-llm/meditron-70b) and [Meditron-7B](https://huggingface.co/epfl-llm/meditron-7b) on Huggingface. 

🩺 We're now working on the next generation of Meditron, building on Meta's Llama-3.
